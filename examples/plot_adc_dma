#   This file is provided to enable easy plotting of data captured from the
#   ADC Continuous DMA example program.  The data is plotted via gnuplot.
#
#                    http://www.gnuplot.info
#
#   After the example program has run, create the plot by executing
#   "gnuplot plot_adc_dma" from the command line.  This plotting file
#   assumes you ran the example with all ADCs collecting data.
#
#   Note that large files can be difficult for gnuplot to render in
#   a meaningful amount of time.
