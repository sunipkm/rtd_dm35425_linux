v01.00.00 (rev A)   8/7/2014  RGG
-----------------------------------
- Initial version


v02.00.00 (rev B)   3/20/2016  RGG
-----------------------------------
- Explicitly calling pci_set_master in driver to allow DMA, as some
  UEFI BIOS do not set this in PCI space.
- Removed library function _Find_Used_Buffer because it had some inherent flaws
  and in very remote cases could fail.  The user is now responsible to keep
  track of what buffer is next.  All examples using DMA have been updated to
  demonstrate how to do this.
- Changed method in library for setting sample/conversion rate.  It now gets the 
  system clock from another library call (which constrains it) instead of reading
  it directly.  This solves a problem where consecutive calls to set the same
  sample rate was resulting in different rates for different function blocks.
- Added adc_fifo examples to show using the FIFO for data transfer without DMA.
- Added adc_all_dma, showing use of all of the ADC channels simultaneously.
- Removed library function for setting ISR priority.  Using it required being root,
  and it's not actually needed anyway.
  

v03.00.00 (rev C)    05/16/2017     RGG
---------------------------------------
- Added revision info from GBC registers to list_fb example output.
- DMA Buffer setup library call changed.  It now takes a single unsigned
  8-bit value for the register instead of booleans for every bit.
- Dma Initialize and other functions moved out of DMA library and into 
  os-specific library.
- Added reference count to driver.  This prevents the device file from being
  opened while already held open by another program.
- All instances of CLK_SRC_GBL have been changed to CLK_BUS for clarity.
- Removed setting rate in _dac example, as it is not needed.
- Example program adc_continuous_dma did not work correctly.


v03.00.01 (rev D)  03/05/2020  LRF
-----------------------------------
- Added Support for the Linux 5.0 Kernel Module make.
- Added support for 5.0+ kernel module dma functions.  
- Added support for 5.6+ Kernel, Removed the ioremap_nocache(...) and replaced with
its nondeprecated version ioremap(...) that accomplishes the same thing.

v03.00.01 (rev D1) 05/15/2023 SKM
-----------------------------------
- Git-ified the repository.

v03.01.00 (rev E) 05/18/2023 SKM
-----------------------------------
- Added ADC Multi-board Readout API
